mem

8MB - memory



4-way set-associative cache

block size - 16 bytes
blocks in set - 4 blocks
sets in cache - 16 sets

so that, total cash memory:
16 sets * 4 blocks * 16 bytes = 1024 bytes

cash memory - 1KB

address mapping to bits:
offset - 4 bits             (block size 16 byte)
set index - 4 bits          (sets in cache 16 sets)
tag - 20-4-4 = 12 bits      (diff from address size and offset size + set index)



CPU

memory is 8BM, so that CPU address request - 20 bits
max address - 0xFFFFF
